# GitHub Pages _Create a site or blog from your GitHub repositories with GitHub Pages._
Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
Welcome to GitHub Pages and Jekyll :tada:!

The first step is to enable GitHub Pages on this repository. When you enable GitHub Pages on a repository, GitHub takes the content that’s on the main branch and publishes a website based on its contents.

:keyboard: Activity: Enable GitHub Pages
Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
Under your repository name, click Settings.
Click Pages in the Code and automation section.
Ensure “Deploy from a branch” is selected from the Source drop-down menu, and then select main from the Branch drop-down menu.
Click the Save button.
Wait about one minute then refresh this page (the one you’re following instructions from). GitHub Actions will automatically update to the next step.
Turning on GitHub Pages creates a deployment of your repository. GitHub Actions may take up to a minute to respond while waiting for the deployment. Future steps will be about 20 seconds; this step is slower. Note: In the Pages of Settings, the Visit site button will appear at the top. Click the button to see your GitHub Pages site.
